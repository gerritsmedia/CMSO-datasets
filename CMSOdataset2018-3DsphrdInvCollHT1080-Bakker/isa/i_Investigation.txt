Investigation Identifier	2018_3DsphInvasion				
Investigation Title	2018_3DsphInvasion_HT1080_Collagen				
Investigation Description	3D multicellular spheroid invasion assay and analysis, following the standardized Multimot protocol from workpackage 6, applied to the HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line. The invasion phenotype was modulated by the collagen matrix density, by using two different concentrations of collagen solution.

STUDY					
Study Identifier	2018_3DsphInvasion_HT1080_Collagen				
Study Title	Standardized 3D culture and analysis of HT1080 fibrosarcoma spheroid invasion assay.				
Study Description	3D multicellular spheroid invasion assay and analysis, following the standardized Multimot protocol from workpackage 6, applied to the HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line. The invasion phenotype was modulated by the collagen matrix density, by using two different concentrations of collagen solution. The low concentration resulted in a more single cell invasion phenotype, while the high concentration induced a more collective invasion phenotype.

Comment[Study Conclusions]	For HT1080 fibrasarcoma, the low collagen matrix density resulted in a more single cell invasion phenotype, while the high concentration induced a more collective invasion phenotype. Thereby, the results are in line with previous observations [A. Haeger et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1840 (2014) 2386–2395]
